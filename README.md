# Twitter-Project
Scraped tweets for a data analysis project on how people get news from Twitter in Fall 2021. Requires access to Twitter's API.

Input a list of twitter accounts and output a table in an excel file with statistics about each account - notably the average amount of retweets
and favorites per the past 500+ tweets as a comparative engagement measurment. Two other programs include exploring sentiment analysis with "Facebook"
as a keyword, one statically, and one streaming and printing tweets in realtime.
